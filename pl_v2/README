This folder is the workings of my ongoing project to create a version of my PS/2 transiever using strictly CMOS logic ICs.

Thus it is much more modular than the VHDL in `../pl` and contains multiple architecture definitions for the FSM. The first definition is described more behaviourly as a starting point, and--in my opinion--better written than my previous version in `../pl`. The second definition contains derived gate level logic which I have simulated to verify the logic I would implement in discrete logic ICs. The output logic is yet to be defined in gate level logic.
